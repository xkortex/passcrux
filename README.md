If you are like me, you loathe single points of failure, *especially* when it comes to passwords, 
and **extra-especially** when it comes to "master" passwords which guard things like password managers. 
Some password managers have mechanisms to reset your password, however every password reset-function is an 
increased attack surface. Plus, there is always the spectre of a password manager provider going under, 
or getting hacked, or whatever. I wanted a way to back up my "master" passwords under my own terms. 

PassCrux gets to the crux of this matter, and has only a transient resemblance to crux-sounding recovery 
schemes found in some magical literature ;). It works by separating your password - or any data - into shards, 
that you can do anything you want with. Just provide `M` of the `N` shards and you can recover the original data. 
If you haven't been living in a cursed cave for the past two decades, you'll recognize this as 
[Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) algorithm, which is indeed 
at the heart of this tool. It's basically a lightweight wrapper around SSS, with built-in helpers and formatters
for storing the shards in human-readable format. 

## Testimonials 

> Heck, that sounds so fun! I can't wait to lose my master password!

## Usage

To split a password from a prompt, into 5 shards with 3 needed to reconstruct, enter 
```bash
passcrux split --ratio 3/5 --prompt 
```

Out:
```bash
a38f786f19680cb3
c4f5a36d797e336d
38519b5d42021620
f3ab8d463e182893
e4ea839978cc8eae
```

Now, distribute your shards. In this case, we are just going to dump them into a file for this demo. 
Copy (at least) 3 of the 5 output shards and paste into a file, `shards.txt`, one shard string per line. 

`shards.txt`
```bash
a38f786f19680cb3
38519b5d42021620
e4ea839978cc8eae
```

Then run this command to print the secret:
```bash
cat shards.txt | passcrux combine
```

## What to do with shards?
That's entirely up to you! Get creative with it! Here are some ideas to get your ideas churning:
- Stamp them into metal. Hide them in various places. Make a good ol' fashioned pirate map üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
- Use `--enc abc` and mark the letters in your favorite books üìö
- Convert hexadecimal values into notes and make some sweet guitar riffs üé∏
- Give a copy to `M` trusted friends with instructions to delete your browser history üóëÔ∏è


## Building/Installation

#### Turbo-instant docker usage:

```docker run --rm -it xkortex/passcrux [OPTIONS]```

Note: `-it` is required for `-p/--prompt` (interactive password prompt) and `-v` for any file-I/O. 

#### Conventional:

Requires a typical golang environment. Simply run `make` to compile `passcrux` to `$GOPATH/bin/passcrux`

## todo

IANAL and I *think* I am doing this correctly, but if something is in error, please open an Issue or PR to help rectify. Go makes it astoundingly easy to `go get` code and use it in your project, and if you ask me, if you are advertising your code as go-gettable on Github, your intent is to share, but it's not my call, so please clarify if I am in the wrong. 

Thanks!
